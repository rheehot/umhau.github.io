<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Final strategy: I'm going to use CMU Sphinx with a small vocabulary trained to my voice for most commands. &nbsp;I'll use the kaldi-gstreamer-server, or maybe even an online service, for larger, arbitrary pieces of sound - stuff that I can't predict. <br /><br />Which means that I'll have two separate, behemoth systems installed on the computer. &nbsp;Ouch. &nbsp;At least I can stream Kaldi from a different computer. &nbsp;Sphinx should be small enough to not be a problem. <br /><br /><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-09-training-cmu-sphinx-language-model-for %}" target="_blank">Here's</a> what I need to be able to train the command and control language model.</div>
