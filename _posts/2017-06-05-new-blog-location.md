You may have noticed things look a little different.  I'm hosting on Github now!  The site is way faster (and a little more put-together!) and I really like how I post things in the new format.  Stuff is going to look a little different, however, since the old posts are all imported as html from the blogger site.  

I'm going to need another cheat sheet, too.  "basic markdown formatting tags".  It's mostly intuitive, but there might be a few surprises along the way.  If you ever feel like checking out the source for the website, it's also on my github.
