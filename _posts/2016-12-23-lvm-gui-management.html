There's only one GUI tool for working with the Logical Volume Management paradigm, and in Fedora it's already been deprecated without a functional replacement. <br /><br />(Apparently LVM is the partitioning scheme of the future)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a personal note to myself that system-config-lvm is the best way to go, and it's available from the Fedora archives <a href="https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=356769" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;To go straight to the download, go <a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/system-config-lvm/1.1.18/1.fc17/noarch/system-config-lvm-1.1.18-1.fc17.noarch.rpm" target="_blank">here</a>. <br /><br />It was last available in Fedora 19, so who knows how long it'll work for.
