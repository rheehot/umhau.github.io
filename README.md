# nixing around

This is the source for my personal programming website. 

## personal links

* [Basic guide for using markdown](umhau.github.io/markdown_guide)
* [commands for initializing website](umhau.github.io/initialize_website.txt)

## TODO

* the sidebar needs to accommodate being too short. create a media entry in the css file for limited height. (solution: hide categories list? display:__?)

* change the about page...too many violins playing in the first paragraph or two.

* removing the tag cloud scripts sped up the page regeneration from 4 sec to .2 sec. don't bring it back.

* the sidebar looks unbalanced...center it (10% width on each side)

* find a simple way to add more posts.
