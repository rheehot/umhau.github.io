# nixing around

This is the source for my personal programming website. 

## personal links

* [Basic guide for using markdown](/markdown_guide.md)
* [commands for initializing website locally](/website_local_deps.sh)

## TODO

* the sidebar needs to accommodate being too short. create a media entry in the css file for limited height. (solution: hide categories list? display:__?)
* change the about page...too many violins playing in the first paragraph or two.
* removing the tag cloud scripts sped up the page regeneration from 4 sec to .2 sec. don't bring it back.
* the sidebar looks unbalanced...center it (10% width on each side)
* find a simple way to add more posts.
* on each category page, make all pages in the category do infinite scroll under an `<hr>` line and the current list.
* category page lists of posts should match the explore  page lists
* add category for 'procedures' that I do on a regular basis - backing up computers, installing the deps for working with the blog, etc.
