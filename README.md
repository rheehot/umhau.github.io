# The Minimal theme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pages-themes/minimal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pages-themes/minimal) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-minimal.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-minimal)

*Minimal is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/minimal), or even [use it today](#usage).*

## BIG NOTE:

Have a variable that goes right under the title and author and date, that tracks the operating system and OS state (extra packages, etc) that existed during the time of the page's instructions. 




### Previewing the theme locally

If you'd like to preview the theme locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Clone down the theme's repository (`git clone https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal`)
2. `cd` into the theme's directory
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme

### Running tests

The theme contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the theme would build successfully. To run the tests, simply run `script/cibuild`. You'll need to run `script/bootstrap` one before the test script will work.
