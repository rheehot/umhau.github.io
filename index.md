## Welcome | About

This blog attempts to be the sort of thing I used to always hope for when messing with programs and linux.  It's intended for people who are way out of their depth, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.  


This is a place where I'm recording how I did things, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.  Memories of complicated procedures tends to be transient, so this helps me remember how I did things.  Plus, it helps me stay on track when I'm writing it down as I go.  This is my research journal.
