## Welcome | About

This blog is the sort of thing I wish I'd been able to find when I first started messing with programs and linux - ok, it's what I still hope to find when I research things.  It's intended for people who are way out of their depth, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.  

This is a place where I'm recording how I did things, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.  So that mostly just describes myself.  I'll probably forget how I did this stuff, and I want to remember how.  Plus, it helps me stay on track when I'm writing it down as I go.  This is my research journal.
