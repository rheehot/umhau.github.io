You may have noticed things look a little different.  I'm hosting on Github now!  The site is way faster (and a little more put-together!) and I really like how I post things in the new format.  

I'm going to need another cheat sheet, though.  "basic markdown formatting tags".  It's mostly intuitive, but there might be a few surprises along the way.  If you ever feel like checking out the source for the website, it's also on my github.
