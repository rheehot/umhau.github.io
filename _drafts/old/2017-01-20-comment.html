I need it for running my cluster as the thin client - all the more powerful stuff is in use. &nbsp;This is a documentation post, which means I will be leaving step-by-step copy and paste records, but won't be going out of my way to leave any more than that. <br /><h3>Sources</h3><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chrome_OS_devices/Chromebook" target="_blank">Background</a><br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/+OlofJohansson/posts/34PYU79eUqP" target="_blank">Building my own kernel</a><br /><br /><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chrome_OS_devices" target="_blank">Installing Arch</a><br /><h4>Note:</h4>I'm afraid the only "easy" way to change distros on early model Chromebooks relies on borrowing the original ChromeOS kernel as described here. If you want a different kernel you will have to build and sign it yourself.<br /><br />If you're willing to install ordinary x86 Arch you can put it together in a VM, partition the SSD and then copy the Arch partition over raw. The page linked above goes into detail about how to do this and sub in the ChromeOS kernel. <br />http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/181074<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
