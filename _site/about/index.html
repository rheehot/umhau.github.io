<p>This blog attempts to be the sort of resource I used to always hope for when I was getting started with linux.  It’s intended for people who are way out of their depth, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.  This is where I record how I did my projects, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.</p>

<p>Memories of complex procedures tend to be transient, so this also helps me remember.  I also find that tracking each step helps me stay focused.  So, in essence, this is a programmer’s research journal.</p>

<p><strong>This site</strong> was transferred from <a href="https://nixingaround.blogspot.com/2017/10/final-post-here.html">Google Blogger</a>, so most of the oldest pages have a slightly different style.  This is a result of being composed in blogger, rather than in Markdown format like the more recent posts.  <a href="/2017/06/05/new-blog-location">See here.</a></p>

<p><strong>”*nixing around”</strong> is a play on “messing around” and “*nix”, which is used to refer to several related operating systems, primarily including UNIX and Linux.</p>
