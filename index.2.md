## Welcome | About

This blog attempts to be the sort of thing I used to always hope for when I was getting started with linux, and programming in general.  It's intended for people who are way out of their depth, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.  This is a place where I'm recording how I did things, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.  


Memories of complex procedures tend to be transient, so this also helps me remember how I did things.  I also find that tracking each step helps me stay focused.  So, in essence, this is a programmer's research journal.
